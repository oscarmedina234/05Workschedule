# 05Workschedule

## Description

Created this web app to be able to allow users to add events for the hour of the day. This web app uses JQuery, local storage and Day.js. Local storage allows users to store their event info even upon page refresh. Through out the day the time blocks will update their classes to represent past present and future. This is alter the time blocks background color based on time of day. 

## Usage

To use the app the user will on page load will be greeted with the current date and time blocks for an average work day. The user can add events to each time block in the text field. When the user clicks the save button on the right, the event info would be saved in local storage and upon refresh will stay in that time block. To clear the event either clear your local storage or rewrite over the existing event.
